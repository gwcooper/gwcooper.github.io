# Hello, world!

Yes, it's a rather clich√©d way to start a blog that is in part about coding, but code reuse is key. A good sense of humour is apparently optional.

I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to put here, but it will largely be things that interest me such as:

* Algorithms and Datastructures (hello, recruiters!)
* Biology and Bioinformatics
* Deep learning / machine learning applications
* Time series forecasting 
* Data visualisation

Please take a look around, and thank you for your time.
