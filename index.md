# Hello, world!

Yes, it's a rather clich√©d way to start a blog that is in part about coding, but the reusabilty principles should not be ignored.

I'm not quite certain exactly what I'm going to put here, but it will largely be things that interest me such as:

* Algorithms and Datastructures (hello, recruiters!)
* Biology and Bioinformatics
* Deep learning / machine learning applications
* Time series forecasting 
* Data visualisation

Please take a look around, and thank you for your time.

## About me

I'm an ex-biochemistry grad student turned research engineer working at a start up focusing on human health. I'm passionate about science, great food, the idea of exercise, and above all learning.

You can learn how to set up your own blog [here](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/); it is incredibly simple and minimal to no coding knowledge is required.

You can also learn how blog using Jupyter Notebooks from the same good people [here](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/20/nb2md/).
